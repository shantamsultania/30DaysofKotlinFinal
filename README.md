# Developing Environment 

## Kotlin 

On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language is now its preferred language for Android app developers.
Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler.
Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.
Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library,but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

## Android 

Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance,with the main contributor and commercial marketer being Google.

Initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007, with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008.
The current stable version is Android 10, released on September 3, 2019. 

## Android Studio 

Android Studio supports all the same programming languages of IntelliJ 
e.g. Java, C++, and more with extensions, such as Go; and Android Studio 3.0 or later supports Kotlin and all Java 7 language features and
a subset of Java 8 language features that vary by platform version.

The following features are provided in the current stable version:.

1) Android-specific refactoring and quick fixes.
2) Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version compatibility and other problems.
3) ProGuard integration and app-signing capabilities.
4) Template-based wizards to create common Android designs and components.
5) A rich layout editor that allows users to drag-and-drop UI components,option to preview layouts on multiple screen configurations.
6) Support for building Android Wear apps.
7) Built-in support for Google Cloud Platform, enabling integration with Firebase Cloud Messaging (Earlier 'Google Cloud Messaging')and Google App Engine.
8) Android Virtual Device (Emulator) to run and debug apps in the Android studio.
